   Milliways: the Restaurant at the End of the Universe is a text-based game coded in Zork Implementation Language.
   
   Currently it is in version 3.04 (post-comp phase). Milliways placed tied 46th in IFComp, almost fully due to a multitude of bugs (and then there were those few who believed that the game had to directly replicate the writing of renowned Douglas Adams for it to be even worth playing...)

### BLURB
   In Milliways: The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, every step you take has an equal probability of sending you over the edge of perilous cliff drops or spinning into the stratosphere. But before that all happens, you have a choice: should you hitchhike the galaxy, or stay home and drink beer?

   Oh, right. That was in the first game.

   As this game begins, you find yourself on the ramp leading from the hatchway down to the surface of the legendary lost planet of Magrathea. Soon, you will find yourself exploring dead planets, escaping white mice, navigating the fjords of Norway, and of course - at Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe!
