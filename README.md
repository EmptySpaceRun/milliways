   Milliways: the Restaurant at the End of the Universe is a text-based game coded in Zork Implementation Language.
   
   Currently it is in version 2.12 (beta phase). This is likely to be the second(/third)-to-last update I will make make before it is published in IFComp.

## blurb
   In Milliways: The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, every step you take has an equal probability of being sent over the edge of perilous cliff drops or hurled into the stratosphere by hostile creatures. But in Milliways, at least you have a choice: do you want to go and expolore the galaxy, or stay home and drink beer?
   
   Oh, right. Your home was destroyed ages ago. I guess there's only one way to go then.
   
   As the game begins, you find yourself on the ramp leading from the hatchway down to the surface of the legendary lost planet of Magrathea. Become Arthur Dent as you find yourself exploring dead planets, escaping life-threatening situations, navigating the fjords of Norway, destroying frobs, and of course - at Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe!
